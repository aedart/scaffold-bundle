## Contribution

Have you found a defect ( [bug or design flaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug) ), or do you wish improvements? In the following sections, you might find some useful information
on how you can help this project. In any case, I thank you for taking the time to help me improve this project's deliverables and overall quality.

### Bug Report

If you are convinced that you have found a bug, then at the very least you should create a new issue. In that given issue, you should as a minimum describe the following;

* Where is the defect located
* A good, short and precise description of the defect (Why is it a defect)
* How to replicate the defect
* (_A possible solution for how to resolve the defect_)

When time permits it, I will review your issue and take action upon it.

### Fork, code and send pull-request

A good and well written bug report can help me a lot. Nevertheless, if you can or wish to resolve the defect by yourself, here is how you can do so;

* Fork this project
* Create a new local development branch for the given defect-fix
* Write your code / changes
* Create executable test-cases (prove that your changes are solid!)
* Commit and push your changes to your fork-repository
* Send a pull-request with your changes
* _Drink a [Beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer) - you earned it_ :)

As soon as I receive the pull-request (_and have time for it_), I will review your changes and merge them into this project. If not, I will inform you why I choose not to.

## Acknowledgement

* [ Laravel ](https://laravel.com), `Taylor Otwell`; and especially for his [Service Container](https://laravel.com/docs/master/container), that I'm using daily
* [ Symfony ](http://symfony.com/), `Fabien Potencier`; not sure how I would be writing console commands without the Symfony Console component!
* [ Laracasts ](https://laracasts.com/), `Jeffrey Way et al.`; worth every penny…
* [ PHPUnit ](https://phpunit.de/), `Sebastian Bergmann`; By the gods ... I still know some developers, managers and decision makers, that believe good software does not require testing, at all! I cannot image working on any project, without good testing tools, such as PHPUnit.
* [ Codeception ](http://codeception.com/), `Michael Bodnarchuk`; for making PHPUnit even better.
* [ Composer ](https://getcomposer.org/) & [ Packagist ](https://packagist.org/), `Nils Adermann, Jordi Boggiano & et al.`; amongst the best things that has happened to the PHP community.
* [ Git ](http://git-scm.com/), `Software Freedom Conservancy`; without it… We would still be stuck in the "stone age" of software development.
* [ PHP ](http://php.net/), `Rasmus Lerdorf & The PHP Group`; we might be developing in old fashioned ASP… (Shivers!)
* [ PHPStorm ](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), `Jetbrains`; for developing the best PHP-IDE, and supporting this and other [OpenSource](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) projects
